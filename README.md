Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithm. Implemented using Python

# Contributors

# Status
**Finished**

# Quickrun
We are using Python 3.5 for the development enviornment, so you might
want to make sure Python35 is installed. Also, `cd` into decision-tree
directory if you are not already, and make sure the `driver.py` file
is there.

```
python driver.py dataset/{filename}.txt
```

You will be greeted with instructions after that, and you can follow
them easily.

# To Do
